(* The correct position to get the lowest fuel cost for
   this assignment being the same as the "median" might
   at first glance seem like a pure guess.
   But if you look up the definition of "Geometric median"
   you'll realize that the position you're looking to find
   in this assignment is the exact same as "Geometric median".
   You can find this information on for example this wikipedia
   page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_median 

   In fact, the first sentence on this wikipedia page, at least
   as I write this, reads as follows: 
   "The geometric median of a discrete set of sample points in a 
    Euclidean space is the point minimizing the sum of distances 
    to the sample points" 

    It even goes on to say:
    For the 1-dimensional case, the geometric median coincides with the median.
    This is because the univariate median also minimizes the sum of distances 
    from the points. (More precisely, if the points are p1, â€¦, pn, in that order, 
    the geometric median is the middle point "p {( n + 1 ) / 2}" if n is odd, but 
    is not uniquely determined if n is even, when it can be any point in the line 
    segment between the two middling points p {n / 2} and p {( n / 2 ) + 1} . *)
